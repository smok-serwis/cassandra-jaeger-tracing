# A Jaeger tracing plugin for Cassandra

This repository is a continuation of [https://github.com/infracloudio/cassandra-jaeger-tracing](https://github.com/infracloudio/cassandra-jaeger-tracing).

**This works on Cassandra 5.0.2**

Cassandra provides [pluggable tracing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160402125018/http://www.planetcassandra.org/blog/cassandra-3-4-release-overview/)
starting from version 3.4. In versions 4 and 4.1 it was significantly altered, but the maintainers
didn't tell us that. More changes were introduced by Cassandra 5. By adding a jar file to the Cassandra classpath and one JVM option, Cassandra's tracing can be
replaced with Jaeger. It is meant to continue parent traces made by your microservices.

### How to use even simpler

## How to use
- Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and
  [JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) installed on your machine.
If you don't like to cloning and building Java, you can always type
-
```bash
mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=co.smok.cassandra:cassandra-jaeger-tracing:5.0.2
```
  But first make sure to configure GitHub's Maven repository. 
- Run following commands to build and place the jar
  ```sh
  # Cloning the repository
  git clone https://github.com/smok-serwis/cassandra-jaeger-tracing.git
  cd cassandra-jaeger-tracing

  # Create a jar file
  mvn package
  cp target/cassandra-jaeger-tracing-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar $CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/
  ```
  Here, `$CASSANDRA_HOME` is the directory where Cassandra is installed
- Start Cassandra with,
  ```sh
  JVM_OPTS\
  ="-Dcassandra.custom_tracing_class=co.smok.cassandra.tracing.JaegerTracing" \
  cassandra
  ```
  or edit the `jvm.options`

By default
[`jaeger-client-java`](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java)
sends the spans to `localhost:6831` via UDP. This can be configured by
setting environment variables, `JAEGER_AGENT_HOST` and
`JAEGER_AGENT_PORT`. Refer [Configuration via
Environment](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/tree/master/jaeger-core#configuration-via-environment)
for more information.
You can also configure `JAEGER_ENDPOINT` instead to connect directly to collector. This is useful, because traces sometimes become quite large
and TCP is needed to shop them.

## Background

This repository was originally based of [bhavin192](https://github.com/infracloudio/cassandra-jaeger-tracing) plugin, 
which originally worked with Cassandra 3, however since multiple revisions of Cassandra have changed the tracing API this solution became unusable.

Since bhavin192 has no time to maintain this repo. I've decided to take over the repository and rename it.

## Troubleshooting

When this tracing is used instead of Cassandra's default tracing, any
cqlsh statements run after enabling tracing with `TRACING ON;` are
going to time out eventually giving

``` 
Unable to fetch query trace: Trace information was not available within â€¦
```

This is because traces are stored within different tables than Cassandra expects them to be (system_traces).
an easy fix around this behaviour in cqlsh is to reduce
`Session.max_trace_wait` down to 1 second.

### Continuing parent traces

In order to continue a parent trace send the trace injected.
into custom_payload with the _trace_id_key_. Default is `uber-trace-id`, but it can be changed through an environment variable.
Inject it using TEXT_MAP TextMap codec with url encoding value of false.

Refer to your Cassandra driver documentation in order
to figure out how to send custom_payload.

If you need a custom trace key, specify it in environment
variable `JAEGER_TRACE_KEY`. Note that the default 
is `uber-trace-id`.

You will also need to set it for each and every Cassandra.
